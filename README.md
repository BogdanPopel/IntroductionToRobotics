# Homework no.1

RGB LED CONTROLLED BY DIGITAL ELECTRONICS

•Components: RBG LED (1 minimum), potentiometers (3 minimum), resistors and wires (per logic).
•Technical Task: Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the colors of the RGB LED (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics.
•Coding task: Coding style is of utmost importance. You must have aperfectly clean code in order to receive the maximum grade.

##### [This](https://youtu.be/3S08bdfMk_I?t=61) is how it looks in lower light conditions.

The circuit is a fragile build, due to imperfect connections between the cables, potentiometers and the breadboard. Therefore, any movement may cause flickering in the LED. To see this, check out [this part of the demo](https://youtu.be/3S08bdfMk_I?t=117).
